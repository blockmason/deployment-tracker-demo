# Deployment Tracker

This demo app illustrates how Blockmason Link can be used to build a
dashboard for your team showing the currently deployed versions of
services across your infrastructure. It serves as a reference
implementation for those who may want to build a similar app using
Blockmason Link.

## Usage

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** This app requires some configuration before launching.
> See the *Configuration* section below for details.

To launch this app:

 1. Clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/blockmason/deployment-tracker-demo.git`.
 2. Switch to the repo's directory and run `yarn install` to install its dependencies.
 3. Run `yarn start` to launch the app at https://localhost:1234.

## Configuration

In order to get data to appear on the dashboard, you will need to
create an account at https://mason.link/. Sign up is free and should
only take a minute.

Once you are signed in to Link, you should see an IDE with some sample
code in it. Copy and paste the contents of this repo's
**contracts/DeploymentTracker.sol** file into the editor and save it.

At the bottom of this editor is a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
You can use these credentials to initialize the [Link SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockmason/link-sdk)
in **src/index.js**.

## Managing Deployments

Deployments will not appear in this app until there is at least one
deployment to the monitored apps and environments specified in
**src/redux/actions/list-apps/index.js** and
**src/redux/actions/list-environments/index.js**, respectively.

In a Node.js console within this repo, the following snippet will
populate your project with sample deployment data:

```javascript
const { link } = require('@blockmason/link-sdk');

const project = link({
  clientId: '<your-client-id>',
  clientSecret: '<your-client-secret>'
});

Promise.all([
  project.post('/setAppLabel', { id: 1, label: 'widgets-api' }),
  project.post('/setEnvironmentLabel', { id: 1, label: 'staging' }),
  project.post('/startDeployment', { app: 1, environment: 1, version: '1.0.0' })
]).then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```
